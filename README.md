# Android Developer Nanodegreee Project #3 Popular Movies

## Project Overview
This is the final version from my Udacitiy Nanodegree Popular Movies Project. You can lookup the first
version here: https://github.com/rsauerwein/Popular_Movies-Stage1

Maybe I'll improve this app further after finishing my Nanodegree. But for now it's time to move on.

## Improvements:
- MVVM code
- Offline function (Favorites)
- Share function
- Added Reviews and Trailers to the Detail Activity

## App feature overview
- OptionMenu, which allows you to switch between two overviews:
  - Popular Movies
  - Top Rated Movies
- Provide you more insights on the movie, like release year, description, ...

## API Setup instructions
Insert your key in Api.java

## Lessons learned from this project
- It's some work to refactor existing code to MVVM but it's worth the time as in future it will be easier to maintain the code
- Android Architecture Core Components make the developers life easier
- Better lifecycle understanding
